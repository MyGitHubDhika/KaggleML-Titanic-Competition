-- Version 1:
This Machine Learning project has been finished with around 72% accuracy (not 77%) using RandomForestClassifier, which isn't bad because I'm new to Machine Learning.

-- Version 2:
Improved data cleaning on both train.csv and test.csv. Also added the number of parameters to the model.
I've scored 76% on the competition.
